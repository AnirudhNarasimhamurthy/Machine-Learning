\section*{General Instructions}

{\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You are welcome to talk to other members of the class about
    the homework. I am more concerned that you understand the
    underlying concepts. However, you should write down (and program)
    your own solution. Please keep the class collaboration policy in
    mind.

  \item Feel free ask questions about the homework with the instructor
    or the TAs.

  \item Your written solutions should be brief and clear.

  \item Handwritten solutions will not be accepted.

  \item The homework is due by midnight of the due date. Please submit
    the homework on Canvas.


  \item Some questions are marked {\bf For 6350 students}. Students
    who are registered for CS 6350 should do these questions. Of
    course, if you are registered for CS 5350, you are welcome to do
    the question too, but you will not get any credit for it.
