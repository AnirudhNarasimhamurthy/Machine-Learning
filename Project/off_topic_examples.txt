Im not taking the whole ""Oh I know Java, that must mean I can write in JavaScript too!"" attitude.  I have some education on Java under my belt, but now find myself having to do some PHP web development (which I have little experience in) using Java Script to handle some of the logic.  But before going out and buying 2 or 3 books on JavaScript and diving right into it, I figure I might ask those that might have gone through the same experience.  It appears that JavaScript lives and acts in its own environmnet which makes want to take the approach taking in JavaScript and PHP as a bundled package in my learning endeavors. JavaScript is similar just enough to Java that I will tend to make some dangerous assumptions.  Should I treat JavaScript and PHP as one item, or should I still take this step by step and learn one at a time?   What are some pitfalls that I might run Into?  What are the main differences between the languages?  Is there any litterature that has helped?  Thanks Everybody.  ",java,php,javascript,,,09/29/2011 17:36:12,off topic

That '..' is a real link makes much more sense to me -- the filesystem needs to store a pointer back to the parent directory in order to navigate to it. But I don't see why '.' being a real link is necessary. It also seems like it leads to an ugly special case in the implementation -- you would think you could only free the space used by inodes that have a link count less than 1, but if they're directories, you actually need to check for a link count less than 2.

Imagine the phone is laid vertically, with the screen facing me, the ""up"" vector pointing to the ceil. Whenever I tilt, the accelerometer allows me to get the ""up"" vector info change. The problem is that if I tilt the device and put it horizontally (screen now facing ceil, and ""up"" vector pointing to the opposite of where I am), then the up vector doesn't get updated any more if I rotate the phone horizontally on the table. This is something that clearly is detected by the magnetometer now. So, the question is, when to know where to use acc or mag for each case?

Now my question is; would be be beneficial to alter this table to a InnoDB table? I am working on extending my systems to include API traffic as well, meaning that the table will even the queried even more and I want to make sure that everything runs as smooth as possible. Because of this, I'm slightly leaning towards converting it to InnoDB. However, since the table requires many indexes, I'm thinking MyISAM might work more effectively. Can anyone help me make up my mind? Thanks in advance1",mysql,api,innodb,myisam,indexes,07/05/2012 15:08:22,off topic

We would like to find a way to slave the VAX drive to a Windows PC to recover the data.  I'm not sure what file system the VAX uses, or how I would begin to set up Windows to see that drive (keep in mind I have not yet tried, as the systems are in a 'difficult' area to access, and so I need the plan going in advance).  Will Windows be able to see the VAX/VMS data without special software?  And if not, what might I need to complete the recovery to the WinXP machine?  I (we) greatly appreciate the help!",alpha,vms,vax,openvms,dec,06/17/2012 03:42:37,off topic

Our host (we're on shared hosting) tells us that we essentially need to find out the cause ourselves by inspecting our own error logs. However, my understanding is that this is in fact incorrect, and that the cause can only really be diagnosed by looking at the Apache server logs at the web server level: i.e. the host needs to get involved and look at this, because we obviously don't have access to those logs. I certainly can't find anything in the error logs that we have at our disposal. Thoughts?",php,apache,hosting,,,06/03/2012 21:10:58,off topic

Each storefront has a unique IP, while they of course share the same database, only some products are on some sites.  About a week ago, one of the storefronts became dramatically sluggish.  I’m talking 10+ second load times.  The weird thing is, all of the other sites were still humming along fine at about 4 seconds.  But periodically, their performance will dip as well.  My host said they haven’t done anything to the server, and they corrected a few issues, but even they can’t identify what’s going on.  I’ve decreased the time between log cleaning (even though I don’t think it needed to be).  I do have to add that I have over 100 static pages and our htaccess is pretty big (215k) because of a number or redirects and blocked IPs.  I think it’s a magento issue and not a server issue, but I cant figure out why it’s only this one storefront.  Has this ever happened to anyone else?

I could argue that there is a lot more to software development that knowing the intricacies of web development vs desktop-- there are issues of designing reusable code, design patterns, C# language features, database experience (another place where my experience is light), class design, professional maturity, and so on..  But I fear that these arguments will fall on deaf ears, especially in these times, when there are already so many experienced ASP.NET developers already out of work.  I can sling together a few simple web pages that hit a database and show the data, but this is far from a professional web site, I'm afraid.",career-development,asp.net,c#,,,02/08/2012 02:22:37,off topic

How to implement that the subimage in left up corner is from 0 to half of the width an half of the height and so on?<br><br> - Also what should be a **criteria** to say that the image should be divided? Can I just compute the standard deviation of every subimage and then enter as a criteria any number, and then if the *deviation > criteria* then I divide the image? <br><br>Of course, I don't ask for the whole code, I ask for the instructions, which will help me do it by myself.

I'm pretty good at CSS and HTML and all the prerequisites and I've decided on PHP to be my programming language of choice. Rather than to use JavaScript overrides and stuff like that, I'd rather an all in one database that would deliver the required content and only the required content. Since PHP seems to be quite popular I understand it to be the best for building database based website with templates etc. I use a Mac and purchased a application called MAMP which allows me to run a local PHP server from my computer to put stuff into action. I don't understand half the stuff that's on there, I don't know how to build a database with records, I don't know how the server will resolve conflicts or make calculations or follow select rules... but I'm ready to learn. I'm looking for the ind of book that will start off at the beginning, beginning but will cover a lot, without wasting too much time on a single topic trying to explain simple things. If PHP is not a language I should devote my time to for making functional websites please make a recommendation I also see JSP to be quite powerful but PHP to be simpler. But I'm looking not only at writing the PHP but actually performing many server based functions and handling request after request. Based on my knowledge of JavaScript/CSS/HTML I believe more work should be put on the server since web browser can be unreliable at times. Especially since servers are more powerful and have the capacity to bundle up the source nice and neat and deliver it the browser. does anybody have any good suggestions? If this is not the right place to ask please let me know if there is a site on the Stack Exchange network that would be more suitable.

Secondly (I know this should probably be a different question but it's related to the last sentence of the above paragraph), because our clients will probably enquire about the cookies used by this script, I am thinking of setting the cookies specific to a folder so if any analytics the client has submit the cookies then they can't see the folder-specific cookies. I'm in the middle of setting this up but it's going to take a long time to modify my code for this... basically I will have a get.asp and set.asp inside a folder called cookie, and the cookies will be specific to example.com/cookie. I will then use an iFrame to /cookie/g|set.asp to get or set cookies, and access the contents of the iFrame to get the value.

Currently we are using the Auctiva solutions, but as is obvious by our development of a dedicated site, are seeking to move away from that platform. I am currently researching hosting solutions both cloud based and traditional shared hosting setups. I have developed a clear list of needs. Preferably a dedicated host with root access, but not necessary, a python and django environment with apache server, and also mysql. After researching several services including EC2 and RackSpace cloud solutions I have found that at the lowest tier of rack space service I can expect to pay about $11 a month. On EC2, however, it might be free. My question is this, based on the experience of anyone who has gone through this process will EC2 actually be free? Or in general will it be worth the effort, I've read that their technical support is poor. Secondly I have very little practical experience with this sort of thing, I have hopes for the site expanding, but for now I'm assuming that the traffic at least for the short term will be light, even with light to moderate traffic based on experience with a growing web site how long will it take before I would need to upgrade my servers?

I have found that there is a romanized version of Japanese called Romaji that I could use, is this acceptable to use in a game?  I have read that Romaji is only used as a learning tool to learn English and for road signs, and not used if possible.  Do most Japanese people who play games already know English, is it a waste of time?  If they know Romaji are they probably already going to know English?  What percent of Japanese game players know English?  How much is my Japanese market going to expand by support Romaji or Kanji?",localization,translation,japanese,,,08/18/2010 15:10:39,off topic

On the first run it showed 3 primaries on the 3TB.  I thought great maybe that's the issue.  However they don't show up.  Even if they did I wouldn't know what to do.  Anyhow that's where I'm at.",ubuntu,format,harddrive,,,03/09/2012 01:48:52,off topic

Based on what I've read the salt is always random.  So if you sha1('password' + random_salt1), do you have to store the random_salt somewhere because when you verify sha1('password' + random_salt1) ==? sha1(user_input + random_salt2), you can't guarantee that random_salt1 == random_salt2.  Or is salt like a site_key(a random salt, but only one is stored for the whole site) ?  I get how salt would increase security, but I'm not sure how to implement it correctly such that I can verify what I stored(don't know about this either).

I would want a tablet that I could force to boot into the browser and have the browser always go to the home page (which would be set as the instrument's home page). It wouldn't be that big a deal if the user found some way to navigate away from the instrument, but powering on/off the instrument would always bring it back to the home page. It's OK if I have to learn the native programming language of the tablet to write an app that forces this to happen, I just don't know if it's even possible since these tablets are built for general purpose use.

The system is assembled from about 30 subsystems and should include main links and interfaces between them. Because system is large, single component diagram will be not useful, and I would like to have only one model and many component diagrams, each for the one subsystem. The subsystem diagram includes only subsystem related components and links. Sparx Enterprise  Architect allow to do that, but there is one thing: when I add new provided interface to the existing component it appears in model, but not in all diagrams. It can be made visible diagrams manually by right click on component and selecting ""Embedded Elements"". However, it is not convenient for me to manually update component in all 30 diagrams. Because I am doing reverse ingeneering I update component interfaces very often. Is there a way to update component automatically accordingly to model in all diagrams?

My data compares measurements of different lengths, so for example I have 52 week long samples of 6 different chemicals (times several duplicates), 26 2 week long samples, 12 month long samples, 4 quarterly samples, 2 semiannuals and an annual sample. I have compared the accuracy of each duration with one another for a total of 15 comparisons (week vs 2 week, week vs month, etc) to find how much one deviates from another on average by computing the % bias, where negative bias indicates that the longer of the 2 samples under-reports and positive bias indicates that the shorter of the 2 samples under-reported. So I have an average % bias and a 95% confidence interval for each of 6 chemicals for each duration comparison. My confidence intervals are of varying widths because I obviously have many fewer data points for comparisons involving annual samples. How might I pack this into one nice looking graphic (or color coded table, or something) that can convey the average bias for each chem and the accompanying confidence interval (maybe highlighting those with greater power?) and also for each duration comparison (ideally maintaining some visual representation of relative time lengths). I would be content having 6 graphics (one for each chemical), but I don't think I want 15 (one for each comparison). Any creative solutions?

ARM and x86), the apps written for that OS can only run on one hardware architecture and not the other?",architecture,operating-system,,,,01/19/2012 13:01:23,off topic

I've looked for extensions for mediawiki itself, but I couldn't find any kind of scheduler/planner/queue system that is premade that allows users to reserve a time frame/day to use machine. Additionally it would be nice if anyone could sign up but users were restricted from removing others from the queue(which is why a traditional calendar software with the honor system wouldn't exactly work). The solution doesn't need to be embedded within medawiki itself but must be able to be hosted off of a webserver, do you guys have any suggestions on how I can approach this? The best I can come up with is to buckle down and write my own php/django based site to handle this(I'm not very experienced with either).

Any advice?,"I have seen other questions on this but I thought I would ask and give my specific circumstances and my current tactics.  I am interested in hearing anyone's advice or critique of my plan.  So far, the plan is to take a few programs I wrote as an intern and burn them onto a LightScribe disc along with a few other programs/source code I have written in various languages.  I will be distributing these discs with my resume and letter of recommendation at my interview.  I will also be bringing my laptop with a preconfigured test environment for my tools/applications so that I can show how they work.  I also have developed a small website with a few of my applications that I have developed on it.  Anyone know what else I should do to prepare for the interview?  The interview is for a junior level VB.NET/ASP.NET developer with a hint of SQL in there somewhere.  Also, the position is a contract-to-hire position.  Is this a bad thing or a good thing?  I only have about 6 months ""professional"" experience as a programmer, but I have been writing code since I was in high school.",asp.net,vb.net,interview-questions,.net-interview,,08/06/2011 15:38:45,off topic

However, on reboot I see that it is failing from the commands in the rc.sysinit file.  When I manually run my sysinit script and then reboot, everything works fine.  Am I running into some sort of race condition here where the rc.sysinit umount command is getting run before the other script is done unmounting /opt, or is something else going on?  Or do I not understand how run levels work?

But most of the codes must be C till the system programming part {Kernel, Shell, etc..}.

I didn't manage to get the job as I was shot off at the whiteboard coding challenge, which I found overwhelmingly scary (although my code was not 100% well, it wasn't totally bizarre - in my opinion, it only served to show I wasn't on top of my game when it comes to C). At the end, I didn't get a response to the interview, but interestingly, the QA people felt interested in me and asked me to flee over and have a second interview. I was tasked to describe some really basic python scripts in the whiteboard with graphics, and again, I didn't get it right. I must say I have no formal studies, I left school about 4 years before I could enroll into university (assuming a 100% successful rate in those 4 years) and I have a clear lack of communication skills and a bit of a nervousness problem as well as lack of self-confidence. Furthermore, English is my second language, so it all adds up. What I'm trying to find now is how to improve this ""condition"", what would be the best way for me to try and improve my ability to translate programs into graphics in a way that it is clear and/or represents the idea I'm trying to convey. I've done a few presentations before and I did get some of the graphics looking particularly good, but it is considerably different from doing it with a pen on a whiteboard. Is there any specific part of the university curriculum that requires a lot of these skills that may be worth for me to investigate? How do people practise describing problems in whiteboard drawings?

2. What other platforms is it on?; 3. How much do you charge for your service outside of Apple/Can we have 30%. I answered no to the first question, applying to Android next week for the second, and no to the third. I'm assuming they came back with a rejection because of the third answer. My app has two sides-one for customers and one for businesses. The idea is that the businesses purchase the service for an annual fee from the website, and then the consumer downloads the app for free from the app store. If anyone knows forsure that this is an issue, and I need to rethink literally everything, your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",application,,,,,10/20/2011 17:30:01,off topic

After reading, I have found many ways to play music including XNA, SoundEffect,MediaElement, and MediaPlayerLauncher. Having such a variety to choose from, I am stuck on what would be best for the job. The XNA player seems fully featured but requires me to initialize the gaming-like update loop for it to work. This seems like a waste of resources. SoundEffect seems geared towards sound effect. Media Element seems okay, and Launcher even has a ui! I am trying to stay away from writing my own player so which one should I choose? I am okay with writing some functionality, but it would be nice to have queuing, scrubbing, etc built in.

I was in the middle of resizing the partition when fluxbox crashed. I let the computer keep going till it stopped doing work, and then restarted. I figured maybe the GUI went down but gparted did its job. I restarted, and windows booted. Still said I had 180 gb partition though. Then I ran chkdsk. Even without /f, it started deleting invalid things, and then told me I needed to restart to fix errors. The partition would not boot after that. I'd be curious why chkdsk made it impossible to restart; but I guess it deleted info on important boot files? ",ntfs,linux,data-recovery,file-recovery,partitioning,01/27/2012 18:38:00,off topic

Now screws and bolts have to be sorted in their order of thickness. The catch in the problem is that screw’s thickness cannot be compared by taking two screws. Only a bolt and screw can have their thickness compared. It can be one of 3 conditions a) Bolt will fit exactly b) Bolt will be loose c) Bolt will not go in the screw.",interview-questions,,,,,06/19/2012 18:06:27,off topic

This would be the only solution i can think about due to the restriction that it is VERY difficult to run Mac OS X natively on a laptop or PC.

I have started learning linux os and decided to come to this forum to ask: what networking knowledge do I need for this sort of business? I will cherish and value any advice.

Or is the calculated duration is purely for the implementation phase (codin,testing and debuggin and so on) ?
