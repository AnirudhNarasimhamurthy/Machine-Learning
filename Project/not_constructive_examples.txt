Or is the BLAS still used because many people wrote very excellently efficient routines in it and since then, no one wanted to ""reinvent the wheel""?

I really enjoy coding in Java, love the tools (eclipse, profilers, etc...), cross platform, garbage collection, etc...  What is the best alternative out there?  I'd like to build cool gui's, mobile apps, web apps, back-end integration, pretty much everything and anything.  I don't really want to invest in learning 5 different languages for 5 different scenarios if possible.  I'd love to be contributing to FOSS.  Even if many things aren't there yet, I want to get on the train with a technology that is headed in the right direction.  I supported Java out of the box with 1.0 implementations because it got me off of MS choke-hold.  Now I want to get off the Java train for the same reason - Oracle!  I looked briefly at Parrot VM.  I've never felt too comfortable with Dynamic languages, but if they are really the way to go, I'll battle that early learning curve.  Tried Ruby on Rails for a while, and it was okay, though I missed my Eclipse debugger, code completion, etc., so didn't last long.  Trying out Groovy...but I want to distance myself from any litigation and really want to support freedom.  I'd prefer not to program in C or C++, don't want to do memory management.  So, in conclusion, what is a good next step for an old Java hand?  What languages have seasoned Java professionals moved onto?  Do I need to worry about things like Scala that are designed to run on the JVM?  What does this lawsuit about Dalvik mean?",java,android,oracle,dalvik,,08/15/2010 14:19:50,not constructive

I mean, write it completely in jQuery syntax and all.  But then, I read that it is a really bad idea to make a web app without first knowing how to make jQuery itself.  So I set about learning JavaScript.  I'm at the point where I know enough to make my app.  Likewise, I could make my app in jQuery.  Perhaps this is a matter of preference, but should I make my application in Vanilla JavaScript, or jQuery?  Based on run-time, tradition, or whatever.  I mean, Grooveshark wasn't written in jQuery, was it?  Was Google Docs?  jQuery definitely makes thing easier to develop, but performance-wise?

But, why is Python more powerful than PHP, and why is Java more powerful than Python, etc. In each case, I'm giving instructions to the computer, so why are some languages better at interpreting and executing these instructions?

I have a degree in music composition because I wanted to write music for video games.

I have some experience developing VST plugins and writing in CSound as well. I currently have a job developing web applications in the aforementioned languages. Now they are saying at my age I should have experience in the video game industry, but the catch-22 is obviously that I can't get a job with a video game company if I haven't had a job with a video game company.

And I've already started ripping out the grid system.  But my client wanted to know more reasons why I was doing it this way.  In a similiar position what would you people do?

But lately we are combining Wikis, UML diagrams, prototyping tools, etc... With no really strong policy for standards and tools.

I believe i have a good enough understanding of the language right now to be able to write a voxel based first person shooter. I started making a map maker sort of application just to test my current knowledge and everything seemed to be working smoothely. It parses a txt file in which coordinates for blocks are read and placed. You can then add/remove and then save. Only problem is that the framerates become extremely low when having a lot of blocks on the screen at one time. It is obvious that ogre does not draw geometry when it is not in the field of view of the camera, however, the framerates will drop to around 20 when i have about 200 blocks in front of me. Now i understand that there are alot of optimization techniques that can be used in order to improve performance, but the framerates are so low with so few blocks that i feel like this doesnt require advanced optimization this early (please correct me if im wrong). I have tried to see if the problem was resolution of textures but no change of res changed the framerate. Screen resolution didn't change anything either. It seems like it has something to do with constantly drawing the geometry. I have read other forums and things where chunks are used in order to have one complete mesh per chunk. Correct me if im wrong but a gtx 470 should be able to handle 200 blocks (all drawn) no problem right? Now my question is: should I continue using ogre because the problem is me, or is Ogre not meant for these kinds of things and I start learning OpenGL and take the advanced matters into my own hands?",c++,fps,ogre,voxel,,02/03/2012 17:24:36,not constructive

With some of them, it's simply been a matter of development having stalled or stopped for various reasons, but this fact got me wondering about how long it usually takes for a decent number of non-standard library modules to be released for backwards-incompatible versions of programming languages/programming language environments? What sort of factors (open-source versus closed-source, support for old versions of the language, etc.) affect this time? How often will someone with the right knowhow just take the old library and figure out how to fix it, so to speak, so that it'll work with the new version of the language, and would it be a good idea for that person to post their work somewhere so that other people can use it until a proper new version of the library is released?",python,,,,,11/09/2011 16:21:04,not constructive

There are some powerful aspects of version control that have enabled us to onboard new developers with a few bootstrap files and one simple command to pull the toolchain over.  Recently upgrades to the systems have prompted requests for storing built binaries.  This has been followed on by a request to version the entire virtualized build system.  Each layer added on top creates important relationships between repositories and a good fundamental design is necessary to manage it.  The storing of the toolchain brought instant benefit while the storing of the built binaries brough instant liabilities.

I say that adds too much risk of a breaking change.  What do you prefer to do and why?",code-reuse,teamwork,,,,05/08/2012 17:48:44,not constructive

However, for several years now, I have been working primarily in the .Net space.  Initially, my transition into the .Net world consisted of writing and maintaining VB.Net code.  VS provided almost all of the nice intellisense support I came to expect after years of working with the Eclipse/Java combo.  Eventually my employer decided to do new development in C#.  My initial impression of the intellisense support for C# was less than stellar.  At times it seems as if VS has no background compiler for C#, but occasionally it does something smart, indicating there is some background processing there, but not quite enough to really boost productivity in meaningful ways.

Before anyone asks: Yes, I understand that the event makes ""some"" sense, because there must be a way to know that the object changed.

I'm a pretty new programmer (3 years since my graduation began and 2 years working experience), but the lack of a better way to do that kind of stuff doesn't look like, for instance, Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC, which just works magically.

Now, I have recently started working for a new company where one application is built using Struts, and another using Apache Wicket. I am considering creating my own website using Java and am trying to decide what framework to use. However, doing a quick search for Java frameworks returns more than 50 to choose from! My website is just going to be for my own enjoyment in the beginning, but if it becomes popular it would be good for it to have some scalability, or to at least be able to redesign for that. Of the more common frameworks, what are the main differences between them, and are there instances where one significantly outperforms? For example, high-traffic enterprise applications versus low traffic small applications? I'm also wondering if some are much easier to learn and use than others.

As for why I'm asking, I'm convinced that one of the root causes for many of the security issues we have is the language that we developed this in.  C is the language that's used everywhere and by just about everything.  Libraries, interpreters, compilers, etc. most likely were at least first created in C.  Most languages can even be extended using C.  Therefore, my theory is that if we have a better C than C for creating libraries and what not, then hopefully we'll end up with a more secure computing environment.",c,programming-languages,,,,10/03/2011 20:48:09,not constructive

The reason why NoSQL is because I need to store data records of 100 different companies for every second of the last 30 years. These are already several billion records and every second the data grows and grows. The scheme of the data is quite determined. Every record consists of a company name, a timestamp and a numerical value if you want to consider the record as a row in a table. However, the database also should be fast in reading especially with aggregate functions because there often will be queries like ""Give me the average of the numerical value for the last 10 years of a specific company"". Thats why a distributed file system like that one of Hadoop would be great to handle these tons of data records in a parallel way. And because of the need for a very fast execution of the aggregate functions I think a column-oriented database is the best. Right now I tend towards HBase or HyperTable but more towards HyperTable because some webpages say it is faster.

I for example really dislike Java's date handling. It's pretty cumbersome to use the Calendar class.

So my question is, does anyone else feel this way?  I know the power of using ExpressJS (sinatra) is that it is a lot ""simplier"", but I feel like my code has lost it's ""elegance"" (structure?).  Is it because the ""next generation"" has no ""best"" standards?  Maybe I need a legitimate H+MVC stack for the type of applications I'm implementing (business oriented)? Does anyone have any recommendations on how to improve?  I've been looking at ASP.NET MVC 4 and Rails3 and wondering if I joined the wrong band wagon.  I'd love to learn ASP.NET MVC 4 just to see what they have to offer, but my gut feeling is that node/express/etc. has so much potential... I'm just doing it wrong.

Sooo.... I'm thinking the way forward may be to write a very simple c++ program which takes input from the DGT driver DLL and ""broadcasts"" the piece positions and clock data somehow in a nice, easy to use format.  Then, I'll have an Air app which can listen to these broadcasts and update its whizz-bang graphics accordingly.  Only reason I'm going with Air is that the most recent graphical stuff I've done was in Flashpunk, which I rather like to use.  If anyone has any good reasons why I should look in to something else, then I'd be happy to do so.  ",c++,,,,,12/10/2011 20:51:04,not constructive

My background is primarily in back-end development using Java.  I enjoy web development doing both front and back-end, which is what I'm currently doing.  However, a very big problem is that our group uses tables instead of CSS to do layout.  I, too, do not know how to use CSS for layout.  I started reading CSS Mastery but in the middle of the 3rd chapter I started disliking it because it's fast for me.  I've read table of contents for a bunch of CSS books and the one that I'm considering is ""Smashing CSS: Professional Techniques for Modern Layout"".  So basically, throughout my career I've never used CSS for layout, I've been using tables.  I have an understanding of CSS selectors and font-family stuff.  I'm looking for a book that I can follow that explains layouts for pages and forms - basically to avoid using tables.  Maybe somebody went through this experience and can recommend something for me.

He is insistent that page refreshes are a thing of the past and that we should build the whole website in AJAX.  His only reason why page refreshes are 'annoying' is that they are too slow.  However, the page is running fine without AJAX currently and when I click from page to page, it seems instantaneous to me. It doesn't seem that it would benefit from additional speed, but he just says I'm being stubborn.  I do want to use AJAX for certain features and pages within the site.  I feel like I understand the pros and cons.  He references that gmail is made in AJAX, but the url changes as I go into different mailboxes, so I don't think it is 100% AJAX.  I reference wikipedia, which is actually much more similar to our site, as an example of a highly succesful website which doesn't seem to NEED AJAX.  But he says that's just one example, and that I am fixated on on wikipedia.  When I tell him that AJAX is great, but that most of the internet will still require page refreshes and page links, he thinks I'm crazy.  When I tell him that using AJAX when not needed will make the back-button useless, he tells me that I'm obsessed with the back button.  I think AJAX is something that can be added later to make functionality smoother on certain features, but that it is OK to build the core of the website without it for now.  Who is right?  Is he obsessed?  Or am I stubborn?",ajax,,,,,09/11/2010 15:36:13,not constructive

What would it take to make you change your mind and decide to use a newer language with fewer of these kinds of warts?
