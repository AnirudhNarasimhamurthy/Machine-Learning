\section*{What To Submit}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The report should detail your experiments. For each step,
  explain in no more than a paragraph or so how your implementation
  works. You may provide the results for the final step as a table or
  a graph. Describe what you did. Comment on the design choices in
  your implementation. For your experiments, what algorithm parameters
  did you use? Try to analyze this and give your observations.

\item Your report should be in the form of a \emph{pdf} file, \LaTeX
  ~is recommended.

\item {\em Your code should run on the CADE machines}. You should
  include a shell script, {\tt run.sh}, that will execute your code
  in the CADE environment. Your code should produce similar output
  to what you include in your report.
  
  You are responsible for ensuring that the grader can execute the
  code using only the included script. If you are using an esoteric
  programming language, you should make sure that its runtime is
  available on CADE.

\item Put your project code in a single directory, and the best is to
  create a compressed tar/zip file of code and script used to run it.
  Please do not hand in binary files.

\item Please look up the late policy on the course website.
