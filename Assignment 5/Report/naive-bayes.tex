\section{Na\"ive Bayes}
\label{sec:bayes}
Consider the Boolean function $f_{TH(3,7)}$.  This is a threshold function defined on the 7 dimensional Boolean cube as follows: given an instance $x$, $f_{TH(3,7)}(x) = 1$ if and only if 3 or more of $x$'s components are 1.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show that $f_{TH(3,7)}$ has a linear decision surface over the 7 dimensional Boolean cube.

\item Assume that you are given data sampled according to the uniform
  distribution over the Boolean cube $\{0, 1\}^7$ and labeled
  according to $f_{TH(3,7)}$. Use na\"ive Bayes to learn a hypothesis
  that predicts these labels. What is the hypothesis generated by the
  na\"ive Bayes algorithm? (You do not have to implement the algorithm
  here. You may assume that you have seen all the data required to get
  accurate estimates of the probabilities).

\item Show that the hypothesis produced in (b) does not represent this function.

\item Are the na\"ive Bayes assumptions satisfied by $f_{TH(3,7)}$?  Justify your answer.

\end{enumerate}
